NASA Space Apps Challenge 2021: Team Kaleidoscopic Kids from Ghazipur, India.


HELLO, SPACE APPS COMMUNITY!

We’re very excited to embark with you all on this journey!

Team Name: Kaleidoscopic Kids
Motto: Color the space
Challenge: Artfully Illuminated Asteroids

Kaleidoscopic view for - The Lucy Space Mission

We are young and have prepared a Kaleidoscopic view for the Lucy Space Mission. We are assisted by our parents as we are under 13 and have been monitored so that we do not break computer or mobiles or hurt ourselves (Which we regularly!)

We are three brothers from India:
Mohd Ashar Jamal Faiz, 5+ Years
Mohd Rayan Jamal Faiz, 2+ Years
Mohd Zohan, 5+ Years

We are deeply intrigued by skies and we know someday we will become astronauts. We have created two Art works: First is our imagination of how Lucy Mission will look like when nearing to one of the asteriods; And, our youngest Rayan has tried to select small stones for all the asteroids belt depiction. Second is our imagination of Volcanoes on any asteroid as there may be gigantic eruptions as well in some metallic asteroids.

We’re very excited to embark with you all on this journey! The Challenge we chose is Artfully Illuminated Asteroids. Our intention is to create a kaleidoscopic view for The Lucy Space Mission. We looked into the resources related to the Lucy Space Mission which is planned to be launched soon. We learnt about asteroids and designed to watch it through mobile camera lens. We also used SparkleBox Junior Robotics Kit sold on Amazon India.

As we are under 13, we have been monitored by our parent Mohd Anwar Jamal for putting all on the internet, github and Youtube for public viewing and judging.

And, we are proud to have this listed as first video on the Youtube channel for W3LC (World Wide Web Learners Consortium).

Welcome to our Kaleidoscopic world!
