Kaleidoscopic view for - The Lucy Space Mission

We are young and have prepared a Kaleidoscopic view for the Lucy Space Mission. We are assisted by our parents as we are under 13 and have been monitored so that we do not break computer or mobiles or hurt ourselves (Which we regularly!)

We are three brothers from India:
Mohd Ashar Jamal Faiz, 5+ Years
Mohd Rayan Jamal Faiz, 2+ Years
Mohd Zohan, 5+ Years

We are deeply intrigued by skies and we know someday we will become astronauts.

We are assisted by our parent Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz
