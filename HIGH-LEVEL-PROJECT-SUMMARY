HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY


Weâ€™re very excited to embark with you all on this journey! 

Our Team name is Kaleidoscopic Kids. Our Motto is Color the space. 

The Challenge we chose is Artfully Illuminated Asteroids. Our intention is to create a kaleidoscopic view for The Lucy Space Mission. 

We are three brothers from India: Ashar Jamal, Rayan Jamal and Mohd Zohan. 

We are young and have prepared a Kaleidoscope and looked into resources related to the Lucy mission. 

We learnt about asteroids and designed to watch it through mobile camera lens. 

We also used SparkleBox Junior Robotics Kit sold on Amazon India. 

As we are under 13, we have been monitored by our parent Mohd Anwar Jamal.
