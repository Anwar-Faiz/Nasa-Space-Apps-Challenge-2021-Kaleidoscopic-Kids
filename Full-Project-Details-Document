Kaleidoscopic Kids: Simulating artistic kaleidoscopic view for The Lucy Space Mission


HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Weâ€™re very excited to embark with you all on this journey! Our Team name is Kaleidoscopic Kids. Our Motto is Color the space. The Challenge we chose is Artfully Illuminated Asteroids. Our intention is to create a kaleidoscopic view for The Lucy Space Mission. We are three brothers from India: Ashar Jamal, Rayan Jamal and Mohd Zohan. We are young and have prepared a Kaleidoscope and looked into resources related to the Lucy mission. We learnt about asteroids and designed to watch it through mobile camera lens. We also used SparkleBox Junior Robotics Kit sold on Amazon India. As we are under 13, we have been monitored by our parent Mohd Anwar Jamal.

DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Challenge we chose is Artfully Illuminated Asteroids. We created a kaleidoscopic view for The Lucy Space Mission.



We are three brothers from India: Ashar Jamal, Rayan Jamal and Mohd Zohan. We are young and have prepared a Kaleidoscope and looked into resources related to the Lucy mission.



We made real kaleidoscope from mirror and tapes and glitter papers etc. We were intrigued by its beauty. We applied same wonderful view to watch Lucy Mission resources and asteroids etc. We learnt about asteroids and designed to attach it to our mobile camera lens.



As we are under 13, we have been monitored by our parent Mohd Anwar Jamal.

Apart from this we used YouTube for educational videos and for guide to constructing kaleidoscope. The idea was originally four smallest brother Rayan who watches kaleidoscope and space videos a lot. I, Ashar, asked my parents to participate in this and we were motivated by our parents to participate in this challenge.



HACKATHON JOURNEY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First day reused in making kaleidoscope. Second day in attaching it to mobile camera and getting real views.



We got many resources from NASA official website.



We used YouTube for educational videos and for guide to constructing kaleidoscope. The idea was originally four smallest brother Rayan who watches kaleidoscope and space videos a lot.

We are three brothers from India:

Ashar Jamal, 5+ Years

Rayan Jamal, 2+ Years

Mohd Zohan, 5+ Years



We are young and have prepared a Kaleidoscopic view for the Lucy Space Mission. We also used SparkleBox Junior Robotics Kit sold on Amazon India. We are assisted by our parents as we are under 13 and have been monitored so that we do not break computer or mobiles or hurt ourselves (Which we regularly!)

We have created two Art works: First is our imagination of how Lucy Mission will look like when nearing to one of the asteriods; And, our youngest Rayan has tried to select small stones for all the asteroids belt depiction. Second is our imagination of Volcanoes on any asteroid as there may be gigantic eruptions as well in some metallic asteroids.

Overall, it was a great funned learning experience!



We are deeply intrigued by skies and we know someday we will become astronauts.



Welcome to our Kaleidoscopic world!
